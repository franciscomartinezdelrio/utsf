Description: An engine for univariate time series forecasting using
    different regression models in an autoregressive way. The engine
    provides an uniform interface for applying the different models. 
    Furthermore, it is extensible so that users can easily apply their
    own regression models to univariate time series forecasting and 
    benefit from all the features of the engine, such as preprocessings
    or estimation of forecast accuracy.
